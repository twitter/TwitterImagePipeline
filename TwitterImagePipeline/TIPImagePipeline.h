/**
 A pipeline object is the encapsulation of fetching and storing images via requests.
 It encapsulates the caches and networking for fetching and storing operations to utilize.

 ## Execution

 When a fetch is made, the operation will traverse the pipelines caches looking for the desired
 image.  If not found, or a different variant is desired, the operation will proceed to download
 from the network.  Wherever an image is loaded from, it will percolate the loaded image up through
 the caches for reuse concurrently as it vends the resulting image to a delegate or block. The
 order is:

    1. Rendered Memory Cache (synchronously accessed)
    2. Unrendered Memory Cache
    3. Additional Cache(s)
    4. Network

 ## Construction / Reuse

 It is up to the framework consumer to construct and reuse pipelines based on their needs.
 Pipelines support siloing (keeping caches separate), if multiple pipelines are desired.
 The simplest option is to create a single shared pipeline for reuse during the lifetime of the app.

 Here's an example of having a global pipeline for a specific use case (in this example, Avatars):

 @interface AvatarImagePipeline : TIPImagePipeline

 + (instancetype)sharedAvatarPipeline;

 @end

 @implementation AvatarImagePipeline

 + (instancetype)sharedAvatarPipeline
 {
    // Singleton for the Avatar Pipeline

    static AvatarImagePipeline *sPipeline;
    static dispatch_once_t sToken;
    dispatch_once(&sToken, ^{
        sPipeline = [[AvatarImagePipeline alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"com.myapplication.pipeline"];
        sPipeline.additionalCaches = @[ [LegacyAvatarCache sharedAvatarCache] ];
    });
    return sPipeline;
 }

 - (void)fetchImageWithOperation:(TIPImageFetchOperation *)op
 {
     // here's a contrived example of how subclassing might be useful

     NSArray<NSOperation *> *globalHighPriorityOperations = AppGlobalRunningHighPriorityOperations();
     for (NSOperation *dependency in globalHighPriorityOperations) {
       [op addDependency:dependency];
     }
     [super fetchImageOperation:op];
 }

 @end

 ## Using `TIPImagePipeline` objects

 When using _TIP_, there are 2 ways to do image loading.  One is to fetch using a `TIPImagePipeline`
 directly and having a delegate or completion block for handling decisions and results.  Second
 is to use the `TIPImageView` combined with a `TIPImageViewFetchHelper` which encapsulates the
 common logic for tying images fetches to a target image view via a delegate and data source
 pattern.  The first option gives you greater flexibility in how to handle the fetched image, while
 the latter is an easier plug and play.  Both options, however, are built on the use of a
 `TIPImagePipeline` and `TIPImageFetchRequest` requests.

 ## Notifications

 # TIPImagePipelineDidStoreCachedImageNotification

 The `TIPImagePipelineDidStoreCachedImageNotification` is sent whenever an image is cached.
 The notification's `userInfo` dictionary will carry context regarding the image that was cached as
 well as whether the image was manually cached or automatically cached
 (`TIPImagePipelineImageWasManuallyStoredNotificationKey`).

 # TIPImagePipelineDidStandUpImagePipelineNotification

 The `TIPImagePipelineDidStandUpImagePipelineNotification` is sent whenever a new `TIPImagePipeline`
 is initialized.  The _object_ will be the `TIPImagePipeline` and
 `TIPImagePipelineImagePipelineIdentifierNotificationKey` will be populated in the _userInfo_.

 # TIPImagePipelineDidTearDownImagePipelineNotification

 The `TIPImagePipelineDidStandUpImagePipelineNotification` is sent whenever a new `TIPImagePipeline`
 is initialized.  The _object_ will be `nil` and
 `TIPImagePipelineImagePipelineIdentifierNotificationKey` will be populated in the _userInfo_.
