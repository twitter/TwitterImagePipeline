 Additions to `UIImage` for _Twitter Image Pipeline_
 No custom `TIPImageCodec` implementations will be considered with these convenience methods.
 See `TIPImageContainer`, `TIPImageCodecCatalogue` and `TIPImageCodecs.h` for custom codec based
 support.
 @note these additions are built on __CoreGraphics__ and __ImageIO__ support.

Rather than expose a pain point of this method potentially returning `nil`, this method will just return `self` in the case that the bug is triggered.
