/**
 `TIPImageStoreRequest` is a protocol that is to be implemented by an object for encapsulating the
 relevant information for storing an image.

 The store request requires the `imageURL` be provided, but also at least one of `image`,
 `imageData` or `imageFilePath`.

 # Providing multiple representations

 `TIPImageStoreRequest` supports uploading multiple forms (`UIImage`, `NSData` and/or a path as an
 `NSString`).  This can provide optimizations in computation by reducing how many times the CPU
 needs to decode/encode an image for the different representations that are stored in the caches.

 ## Logic for chosing the Memory Cache representation

 * If `image` is provided, use that `UIImage`
 * If `imageData` is provided, construct a `UIImage` with that `NSData` and use it
 * If `imageFilePath` is provided, construct a `UIImage` with that file path and use it

 ## Logic for chosing the Disk Cache representation

 * If `imageFilePath` is provided, copy that file to the disk cache
 * If `imageData` is provided, write that data to the disk cache
 * If `image` is provided, serialize the `image` to `NSData`, then write that data to the disk cache
